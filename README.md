Hi, I’m Joseph Hartono
Systems Architect | ML Operations | Human-Centric Design
I build systems that amplify human potential. As the Program Manager for the AI Lab at Biola University, I focus on the intersection of High-Level Design (HLD) and Organizational Velocity. My goal is to bridge the gap between technical complexity and business value by creating tools that make people perform better and flourish in their roles.

🛠️ How I Work
Immediate Evidence over Slide Decks I believe in the power of the MVP. Whether it’s automating logistics or inventory management, I prioritize rapid validation to show stakeholders real-world impact and trade-offs. By showing results right away, I help teams visualize the value of their time and feel empowered to invest in core business growth.

Bidirectional Alignment I operate from both a top-down strategic perspective and a bottoms-up interpersonal one. By finding the "middle ground" where individual growth meets the company mission, I build high-agency systems that run autonomously. I've realized that most operational bottlenecks are actually misalignments in vision; I solve this by ensuring everyone lands in the same place.

People-First ML I don’t build to replace; I build to unblock. My work in ML and automation is always designed with the end-user in mind, ensuring high adoption through strong UX and a "human-in-the-loop" philosophy. I vet every initiative against its ability to empower the team and align with the long-term vision.

🤝 Connect With Me
I am always looking to learn from others navigating the complexities of people and systems. Whether you are building a team, looking for a collaborator, or just want to swap notes on the future of ML-driven operations, I’m always open to a conversation. Even if you aren't actively recruiting, I'd love to be a resource or a sounding board.
